# Docker Plex & Usenet Media Server #

docker-based plex & usenet media server using custom subdomains with tls

## Changes from V1
- Break each service into individual docker-compose files.  This might make initial start a bit worse, but makes changes and management more readable.
- Move from Plex to Jellyfin
- Change from traefik to caddyV2.  Caddy's config is just easier to work with to me, and being able to make dynamic changes is pretty neat
- Add ebooks through readarr
- Remove deluge because I dont torrent anymore

## Features

## Requirements

- dedicated server or PC with plenty of storage
- windows or linux x86/x64 os (not ARM)
- personal top-level domain with configurable sub-domains (eg. plex.mydomain.com)

## ACME & DNS

The following subdomains should point to the public IP of your server:

- `jellyfin.mydomain.com`
- `sabnzbd.mydomain.com`
- `sonarr.mydomain.com`
- `radarr.mydomain.com`
- `hydra.mydomain.com`
- `ombi.mydomain.com`
- `readarr.mydomain.com`

Caddy, Sabnzbd, Tdarr, Prowlar, deluge, and rutorrent do not need entries because they run internally, and theres really no need to have them outside.  Watchtower theres nothing to serve

## Installation

1. install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)

2. install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

3. clone mediaserver repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elightcap/mediaserver.git
```

## Configuration

Copy `env.sample` to `.env`and `./caddy/sample/env` to `/caddy.env` and fill all required fields

```bash
cp env.sample .env && cp ./caddy/sample.env ./caddy/.env
```

## Deployment

Pull and deploy containers with docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose -f filename-compose.yml  up -d
```

You'll have to go through and up each compose file, and may need to create the docker network first
